# Agile Manufacturing of 5G mm-Wave Components
A project by Abigail Petersen, Nick Piscitello, and Kristina Zunino in
conjunction with Professor Gloria Ma for our senior design capstone at 
Wentworth Institute of Technology

This is a single-page webapp with no backend, built as an example and starting
point for presenting the results of our research in an easy-to-use format.

# Project Abstract
Traditionally, prototyping and producing microwave (specifically mm-wave)
components is a cost and time intensive process. Over the course of this
project, the aim is to compile data examining the role one or many rapid
prototyping techniques could play in reducing the cost and turnaround time for
mm-wave component prototyping. We will focus on additive manufacturing
technologies (3D printing), though other methods may also be investigated. While
we hope to be able to produce a part with comparable performance to commercially
available products, the main focus of this project is to clearly and
comprehensively document the characteristics, desirable and undesirable, of each
manufacturing technique and the parts it produces, even if those parts may not
meet some or all performance requirements.
